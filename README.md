crypt-ik/crypt-ik is trying to find somebody walking help me figure out how to get into a trade website where this momotherfucker changed my username or password in the pump group that I was participating in everyday and have millions of dollars basically everything was taken away from me. This really freaking hurt because my mom is 80 years old and because of me and not having any money now she's working as a cashier at this retail store in Parma Ohio. 
 He pumps out signals everyday on Telegram X and has changed the website name five times since I joined. It's the same exact template exact everything Just changes the domain name. 
  I've been reading up and studying OSINT and various exploits but it's been a long time like since 1994 I believe when coding was different and by the time I catch up no more than likely be too late. I'm leaving want all the money that's why I need to figure out how to fuck him up and some kind of way to screw up his connection to the money or get information how to get my USDT. I only want one quarter the other 3/4 of the money can be used or taking however and disperse however you want I don't care Just want my 25% that's enough for me.
